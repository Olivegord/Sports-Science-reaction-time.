# Sports Science Reaction Time Tester

This repository hosts a lightweight, offline-friendly reaction time tester that can be published with GitHub Pages.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in any modern browser to run the test. The app will guide you through five trials. When the screen turns green, press the **J** key as quickly as you can. The average reaction time is displayed once all trials are complete.

Your most recent session is saved to `localStorage`. Visit `data.html` to review the recorded times in a table. Clearing browser storage removes the saved results.

To deploy with GitHub Pages (user or project site), commit these files to the repository and enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings, pointing it to the `main` branch root.
